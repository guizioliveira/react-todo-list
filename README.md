This is a simple to-do list application using React. The application reviewed basic concepts of states, immutability, rendering, and componentization within the React ecosystem. The educators' team at [@Rocketseat](https://github.com/rocketseat) provided the idea and layout of the application.

> **PS:** The application hosted on GitHub Pages is just a preview of the functionality and design. There is no caching or saving system for the values added by the user. The added tasks are purely illustrative.
